# Boardgames EShop

A responsive web application developed during an internship of 3 months following technical guidance, with almost 0 supervision and no previous knowledge about React and TypeScript (before this I worked with React Native and JavaScript).

During this period, the following functionality became available for the user:
- register, login and update account forms with the option to delete the account
- display all boardgames, with a dedicated page for a boardgame
- sort boardgames menu by release year, price or name
- display boardgames on the main page filtered by name, category and/or page number
- review boardgames (unique account per boardgame)
- buy or add to wishlist a boardgame from the main or dedicated page
- order boardgames based on a shopping cart, with order history available
- some alerts and loading icons for multiple actions

And as an admin:
- delete accounts from an admin page
- add, edit or delete boardgames and their category
- delete reviews from the dedicated page of the boardgame
- update order status from all orders page

Built with React using only React Hooks and TypeScript with MUI. 
The following packages were used: 
- Axios, React Router, React Hook Form, React Icons, React Toastify and jwt-decode

The development lasted until October 2022 and from then on I sometimes come back to the application and use it as a sandbox.
